## About

Discord API Types is a community-maintained project that brings API types for Discord's REST, Gateway and Voice APIs.

## Installation

Install with [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) / [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) / [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.js.org/):

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install discord-api-types
```

### Usage

You can only import this module by specifying the API version you want to target. Append `/v*` to the import path, where
the `*` represents the API version. Below are some examples

<Tabs groupId="ts2esm2cjs">
<TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">

```typescript showLineNumbers
/**
 * @type {import('discord-api-types/v10').APIUser}
 */
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="esm" label="ESM">

```typescript showLineNumbers
/**
 * @type {import('discord-api-types/v10').APIUser}
 */
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { type APIUser } from 'discord-api-types/v10';
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::info

You may also import just certain parts of the module that you need. The possible values are: `globals`, `gateway`,
`gateway/v*`, `payloads`, `payloads/v*`, `rest`, `rest/v*`, `rpc`, `rpc/v*`, `utils`, `utils/v*`, `voice`, and
`voice/v*`. Below is an example of importing directly from the gateway submodule

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { GatewayVersion } from 'discord-api-types/gateway/v10';

console.log(`Let's connect to wss://gateway.discord.gg/?v=${GatewayVersion}`);
```

> _**Note:** The `v*` exports (`discord-api-types/v*`) include the appropriate version of `gateway`, `payloads`, `rest`,
> `rpc`, and `utils` you specified, alongside the `globals` exports_

:::

### Deno

We also provide typings compatible with the [deno](https://deno.land/) runtime. Here are 3 examples of how you can
import them:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="github" label="From GitHub">

```typescript showLineNumbers
// Importing a specific API version
import { APIUser } from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discordjs/discord-api-types/main/deno/v10.ts';
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="deno" label="From deno.land/x" default>

```typescript showLineNumbers
// Importing a specific API version
import { APIUser } from 'https://deno.land/x/discord_api_types/v10.ts';
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="skypack" label="From skypack.dev">

```typescript showLineNumbers
// Importing a specific API version
import { APIUser } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/discord-api-types/v10?dts';
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Project Structure

The exports of each API version is split into three main parts:

- Everything exported with the `API` prefix represents a payload you may get from the REST API _or_ the Gateway.

- Everything exported with the `Gateway` prefix represents data that ONLY comes from or is directly related to the
  Gateway.

- Everything exported with the `REST` prefix represents data that ONLY comes from or is directly related to the REST
  API.

  - For endpoint options, they will follow the following structure:
    `REST<HTTP Method><Type><Query|(JSON|FormData)Body|Result>` where the type represents what it will return.

    - For example, `RESTPostAPIChannelMessageJSONBody` or `RESTGetAPIGatewayBotInfoResult`.

    - Some exported types (specifically OAuth2 related ones) may not respect this entire structure due to the nature of
      the fields. They will start with either `RESTOAuth2` or with something similar to `REST<HTTP Method>OAuth2`

  - If a type ends with `Result`, then it represents the expected result by calling its accompanying route.

    - Types that are exported as `never` usually mean the result will be a `204 No Content`, so you can safely ignore
      it. This does **not** account for errors.

- Anything else that is miscellaneous will be exported based on what it represents (for example the `REST` route
  object).

- There may be types exported that are identical for all versions. These will be exported as is and can be found in the
  `globals` file. They will still be prefixed accordingly as described above.

:::danger A note about how types are documented

This package will add types only for known and documented properties that are present in Discord's
[API Documentation repository](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs), that are mentioned in an open pull request,
or known through other means _and have received the green light to be used_. Anything else will not be documented (for
example client only types).

With that aside, we may allow certain types that are not documented in the
[API Documentation repository](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs) on a case by case basis. They will be
documented with an `@unstable` tag and are not subject with the same versioning rules.
